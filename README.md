TLDR: Simple Countdown to 2021. Followed along with a youtube tutorial.

I have been studying Web Dev for over a year and I've grasped some good fundamental concepts, but haven't really started to put the pieces together yet. I was delighted to find a vast treasure trove of people on youtube problem solving their way through projects and I was really pleased with the learning opportunity this provided me. 

I followed along with the first part of Florin Pop's 10 projects in 10 hours projects. I was able to understand most of the concepts and only had minor errors which I corrected using Visual Studio Code's "compare" feature. 

All of the original learning materials that I used can be found here:

the original inspiration was this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&amp;t=1749s&amp;ab_channel=FlorinPop 

which I would thoroughly recommend if you want to sit in the passenger seat as someone builds a project and talks you through their process. 

Although I made minimal changes (and then later corrected them with the "compare" feature) I still found it a really valuable experience to put everything together and I'm looking foreword to doing more of these as I progress through my course materials.
